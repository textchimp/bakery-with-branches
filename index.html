  <h1>
    Welcome to the GA bakery and also it's a hospice, vertical integration FTW
  </h1>

  <p>
    Here's a new pararaph that was created in THE MASTER BRANCH
    before creating a new branch called "bone-bread"
    • IT IS ALSO IN THE WORKING COPY OF THE NEW BRANCH;
    • changes to this working copy will also be on the master branch when we switch back; branching ignores working copy, or rather "brings it with you" when you switch
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a para that was created ON THE BONE-BREAD BRANCH
  </p>

  <div id="test">new item - actually it's not that new</div>

  <p>Legal notice: our bread now contains 25% less bone dust and chalk - now with added TEETH!</p>
